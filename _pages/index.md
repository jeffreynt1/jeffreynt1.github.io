I am a researcher focusing on the intersection of **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **computational biology/pharmacology**. My work spans compound–protein interaction (CPI/DTI) prediction, multi‑model ensembling/meta‑learning, and large‑scale data engineering for drug discovery.

## Timeline
- **2023 – Present**: Master's student, Zhejiang University (Joint training)  
- **Before**: B.Sc. in Pharmacy, Zhengzhou University

## Research Highlights
- Single‑cell / multi‑omics analysis with deep models  
- CPI/DTI with Transformers, graph learning, and structure‑aware encoders  
- Meta‑learning and ensemble strategies for robust prediction
